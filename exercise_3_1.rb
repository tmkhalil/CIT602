 [1] Define a Document class that has 3 attributes (author, title, price)
      add the ability to read the values, i.e. getters

 [2] Add an addition function that returns a new document that adds the price
     of the books together, the new document should have for the author field and the title field
     a string of of comma-separated strings representing the authors and titles respectively
 of the caller and passed document content. (title and author should be the caller's)
 hint: a plus could be used as a funciton name



class Document
    attr_reader   :author
    attr_reader   :title
    attr_reader   :price
    
    def initialize(author, title, price)
        @author = author
        @title = title
        @price = price
    end
    
    def +(otherObj)
        Document.new("#{self.author}, #{otherObj.author}", "#{self.title}, #{otherObj.title}", self.price+otherObj.price)
    end
end


# These examples should work
a=Document.new("Dan Brown", "Da Vinci Code", 50)
b=Document.new("Bruce Schneier", "Applied Cryptography", 120)

total = a + b
puts total.price
# 170
puts total.author
# "Dan Brown, Bruce Schneier"
puts total.title
# "Da Vinci Code, Applied Cryptography"

total = total + Document.new("Taha Hussein", "Al-Ayam", 30)

puts total.price
# 200
puts total.author
# "Dan Brown, Bruce Schneier, Taha Hussein"
puts total.title
# "Da Vinci Code, Applied Cryptography, Al-Ayam"
